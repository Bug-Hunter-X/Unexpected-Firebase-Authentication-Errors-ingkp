This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Firebase Authentication SDK: unexpected error handling. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a robust solution.  The issue arises from insufficient error handling when attempting to authenticate a user.  The solution implements comprehensive error checking to catch and gracefully manage various authentication failures, preventing app crashes and improving the user experience.
